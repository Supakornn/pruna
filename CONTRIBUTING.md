## Setup

If you want to contribute to Pruna with a Pull Request, you can do so by following these steps.
If it is your very first time contributing to an open source project, we recommend to start with [this guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) for some generally helpful tips.

### 1. Clone the repository

First, fork the repository by navigating to the original [pruna repository](https://github.com/PrunaAI/pruna) on GitHub and clicking the **Fork** button at the top-right. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. Then, clone the forked repository from your account to your local machine and change into its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/pruna.git
cd pruna
```

To keep your fork up to date with the original repository, add the upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/PrunaAI/pruna.git
```

Always work on a new branch rather than the main branch. You can create a new branch for your feature or fix:

```bash
git switch -c feat/new-feature
```

### 2. Installation

You have two options for installing dependencies:

#### Option A: Using uv with its own virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```
This creates a virtual environment in `.venv/` and installs all dependencies there, including pruna itself in editable mode. **Important:** This does NOT install into your current conda environment! Youâ€™ll need to use `uv run` for all commands.

#### Option B: Installing into your current environment (conda/pip)

If you want to install directly into your current conda environment or use pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

You can then also install the pre-commit hooks with:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

**Note:** The pre-commit hooks include TruffleHog for secret detection. TruffleHog must be installed separately as a binary tool. See the [TruffleHog installation instructions](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) for your platform.

### 3. Develop your contribution

You are now ready to work on your contribution. Check out a branch on your forked repository and start coding! When committing your changes, we recommend following the [Conventional Commit Guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

```bash
git switch -c feat/new-feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: new amazing feature setup"
git push origin feat/new-feature
```

Make sure to develop your contribution in a way that is well documented, concise, and easy to maintain. We will do our best to have your contribution integrated and maintained into Pruna but reserve the right to reject contributions that we do not feel are in the best interest of the project.

### 4. Type checking

We use Ty for static type checking. Run:

```bash
ty check src/pruna
```

### 5. Run the tests

We have a comprehensive test suite that is designed to catch potential issues before they are merged into Pruna. When you make a contribution, it is highly recommended to not only run the existing tests but also to add new tests that cover your contribution.

You can run the tests depending on which installation option you chose:

#### If you used Option A (uv):

```bash
uv run pytest
```

For specific test markers:

```bash
uv run pytest -m "cpu and not slow"
```

#### If you used Option B (pip/conda):

```bash
pytest
```

For specific test markers:

```bash
pytest -m "cpu and not slow"
```

Note: `uv run` automatically uses uv's virtual environment in `.venv/`, not your conda environment.

### 6. Create a Pull Request

Once you have made your changes and tested them, you can create a Pull Request. We will then review your Pull Request and get back to you as soon as possible. If there are any questions along the way, please do not hesitate to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JFQmtFKCjd).
